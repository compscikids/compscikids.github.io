									</header>
									<p>After completing the course rigor of high school Computer Science, we realized how much we would have benefited from exposure to the subject in previous years and decided to start a club to do just that. Held at Conant High School, CompSci Kids allows kids of all ages to have a background in the field prior to delving in further in high school. The hope is to allow these students to be able to learn computer science at an accelerated rate in high school and allow those who have natural skills in computer science to further develop earlier on. Through the use of online programs, fun activities, and exciting projects for older students, CompSci Kids provides an enticing venue for students to learn about computer science.</p>
									<p>Each session will begin by picking up the students from door #1 of Conant High School and walking them to the their designated areas. We will then go through our specially designed curriculum making sure each student not only receives as much individual attention as needed but also has a blast learning. Our student to trained high school volunteer ratio will always be around 3:1 ensuring no child falls behind or feels left out. When class is over we will walk the children back to the doors to be picked up by their parents. The last class will be a celebration where the kids can show their parents what they have learned.</p>

									<h3>The Kids</h3>
									<p>All kids will work with the high school students with the goal of exploring computer science. Each level will explore this in a slightly different way. The curricula are specifically designed to be fun and interactive. Computer science is much more than just coding, it is truly about the art of problem solving with the help of technology. The curricula were written with this in mind, and descriptions of the curricula are posted below.</p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="fa-book">1st - 3rd</li>
										<p>As these students are just getting exposed to the world of computer science, we don't work with computers as much in this age level. We try to expose the students to computer science through activities with major underlying concepts of computer science. Towards the end of the course, the students will use Ipads to explore block programming Our objective for students in this course is for them to leave the course with a basic understanding of some major concepts in computer science and to get them thinking about ways that computer science is used around them.</p>
										<li class="fa-book">4th - 6th</li>
										<p>The curriculum is designed to introduce kids to the fundamental concepts of computer science and how these concepts come together to make functioning programs. Students will begin with Alice, a free application created by Carnegie Mellon University that allows for a fun introduction to coding. The Alice program will allow for the students to easily add visual elements through an easy to use interface. This should allow for a fun experience as the students will be able to see their programs come to life by the end of the course. The course will also include fun computer science activities that the students will participate in periodically with their peers to get a better understanding of computer science.     <a href="https://www.alice.org/get-alice/alice-2" target="_blank">Download Alice at Home!</a></p>
										<li class="fa-code">7th - 8th</li>
										<p>As students enter high school, they are already experienced in the use of electronics and computers. In this program, we seek to further their knowledge and introduce them to computer science and programming through game creation in Visual Studio. There will be an emphasis on coding as students learn about variables, control structures, and loops. The course will conclude with a final project synthesizing the material previously learned, which the students will showcase on the last day.     <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Get Started with Visual Studio</a> </p>

									<h3>Register</h3>
									<h4>Opens September 24 at 2PM</h4>
									<p>The price for registration is $15 which covers the price of a shirt, custom lanyard USB, and an end of session celebration. All excess funds will be used solely for the improvement of the program. If you or your child were part of a prior session, priority will be given to new applicants. <br><b>Because of a limited classroom size, only the first 27 kids to register per group will be admitted for the first session. After that, all applicants will be added to a waitlist.</b></p>
