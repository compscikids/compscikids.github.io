									</header>
									<p>After completing the course rigor of high school Computer Science, we realized how much we would have benefited from exposure to the subject in previous years and decided to start a club to do just that. Held at Conant High School, CompSci Kids allows kids of all ages to have a background in the field prior to delving in further in high school. The hope is to allow these students to be able to learn computer science at an accelerated rate in high school and allow those who have natural skills in computer science to further develop earlier on. Through the use of online programs, fun activities, and exciting projects for older students, CompSci Kids provides an enticing venue for students to learn about computer science.</p>
									<p>Our ideal classroom setting consists of picking up the students from the doors of Conant High School and walking them to the their designated areas. We will then go through our specially designed curriculum making sure each student not only receives as much individual attention as needed but also has a blast learning. Our student to trained high school volunteer ratio will always be around 3:1 insuring no child falls behind or feels left out. When class is over we will walk the children hand in hand back to the doors to be picked up by their parents.</p>

									<h3>The Kids</h3>
									<p></p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="fa-book">1st - 3rd</li>
										<p>As these students are just getting exposed to the world of computer science, we don't work with computers as much in this age level. We try to expose the students to computer science through activites with major underlying concepts of computer science. Towards the end of the course, the students are exposed to a little bit of Code.org, which allows students to create projects and learn to code through block programming. Our objective for students in this course is for them to leave the course with a basic understanding of some major concepts in computer science and to get them thinking about ways that computer science is used around them.</p>
										<li class="fa-book">4th - 6th</li>
										<p>Students at this level have basic understandings of computers. Through this program, they will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of computer science and how these concepts come together to make functioning programs. Students will begin with Alice, a free application that allows for a fun introduction to coding. The Alice program will allow for the students to easily add visual elements through an easy to use interface. This should allow for a fun experience as the students will be able to see their programs come to life by the end of the course. The course will also include fun computer science activities that the students will participate in periodically with their peers to get a better understanding of computer science and a break from working on Alice.     <a href="https://www.alice.org/get-alice/alice-3" target="_blank">Download Alice at Home!</a></p>
										<li class="fa-code">7th - 8th</li>
										<p>As students enter high school, they are already experienced in the use of electronics and computers. In this program, we seek to further their knowledge and introduce them to computer science and programming through game creation in Visual Studio. There will be an emphasis on coding as students learn about variables, control structures, and loops. The course will conclude with a final project synthesizing the material previously learned, which the students will showcase on the last day.     <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Get Started with Visual Studio</a> </p>

									<h3>Register</h3>
									<p>The price for registration is $15 which covers the price of a shirt, custom lanyard USB, and an end of session celebration. All excess funds will be used solely for the improvement of the program. If you or your child were part of the first session, please hesitate a few days so those who didn't get a chance can sign up <br><b>Because of a limited classroom size, only the first 27 kids to register per group will be admitted for the first session. After that, all applicants will be added to a waitlist.</b></p>
